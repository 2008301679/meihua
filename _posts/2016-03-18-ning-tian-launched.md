Merrick Garland, President Obama's sensible supreme court choice

If there is any substantive discussion of the nomination, it will be said, often, about Garland that, as a sitting federal appellate judge, he fits the limited career pattern of all but one current Justice and that, as a graduate of Harvard Law School, like four of the current Justices, he would compound the narrow elitism of the Supreme Court if confirmed.

To understand why Garland nonetheless has the most important criterion the President identified for his nominee--"experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people's lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times"--look only at the judge's brief biography on the Web site of the D.C. Circuit. Here I reflect a bias, because I have known him for many years as a friend. I have followed every step of his career and believe I have an accurate sense of him and his accomplishments.

Next to his tenure as a judge, his longest professional experience was as a lawyer at the firm Arnold & Porter, one of the most respected in the country. He became a partner after only four years there--and then, after four more years, he left the firm to become a prosecutor. Merrick made one of the coolest and gutsiest career moves I've never heard of: giving up his highly lucrative and prestigious partnership in A&P to become an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the not-so-wealthy and, quite frankly, not-so-prestigious Washington, D.C., office.

He explained, though, that "the great joy of being a prosecutor is that you don't take whatever case walks in the door. You evaluate the case. You make your best judgement. You only go forward if you believe that the defendant is guilty." He continued, "It is the kind of evenhanded balancing that a judge should undertake, although, of course, the judge has the advantage of having somebody speak for the other side."
