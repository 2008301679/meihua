Long queues at petrol stations are only the most visible `sign` of a battle `over` the future of the French left.

For the past week, France `has felt like` a country `on the verge` of civic insurrection. Union `blockades` of petrol refineries and depots have caused `widespread` fuel shortages. `Some 2,300 petrol stations` have either run dry, or are `rationing sales` at the pump. The government has `dipped into` its strategic reserves to maintain supplies. Panic has created shortages, as motorists queue to fill up their tanks. The `showdown` is fast turning into a battle over the survival of both the Socialist government and the reformist French left.
