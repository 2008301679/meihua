Unloved and unstoppable


In a year of insurgents, Americans appear likely to elect an establishment grande dame as president.

Among the millions of words Hillary Clinton has expended on the campaign trail, these stood out. "That is not easy for me," said the Democratic front-runner, during a televised debate in Florida last month. "I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama." A more straightforward answer to the question posed--why do two-thirds of Americans mistrust you?--might have cited the many scandals that have attended her three decades in public life. An FBI investigation into her casual handling of classified information is merely the latest. But if  somewhat disingenuous, her response was, in its way, accurate and revealing.
