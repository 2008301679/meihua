Deadly earthquakes strike Japan and Ecuador

Two powerful earthquakes struck in different parts of the world on Saturday April 16th. In the early hours of the morning, a magnitude 7.0 quake hit Kumamoto on the island of Kyushu, south-western Japan, less than two days after the same island had suffered a magnitude 6.2 tremor. Forty-two people have died as a result of the Japanese disaster, and more than 1,000 have been injured. A rescue team numbering 30,000 continues to search for survivors and a quarter of a million people have been evacuated amid fears of further shocks.

On the same day, but on the opposite side of the Pacific Ocean, the coastal region of Muisne in Ecuador was rocked by an earthquake recorded at magnitude 7.8--six times bigger than the quake in Japan and 15 times stronger in terms of the energy released.

Both of the Saturday's tremors are located in the Pacific "ring of fire", a 25,000-mile stretch of seismic activity that is home to roughly 90% of the world's earthquakes. Of the 349 quakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher since 1995, 27 have measured upwards of magnitude 8.0, just two of which measured magnitude 9.0.
