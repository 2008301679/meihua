The Mekong - First chapter: Requiem for a river

Guo, the driver, pulls his car to a merciful halt high above a crevasse: time for a cigarette, and after seven hours of shuddering along the narrow, twisting roads, time for his passengers to check that their fillings remain in place. Lighting up, he steps out of the car and dons a cloth cap and jacket: sunny, early-summer days are still brisk 3,500 metres above sea level. Mr Guo is an impish little dumpling of a man, bald, brown-toothed and jolly. He is also anomaly: a Shanghainese in northern Yunnan who opted to stay with his local bride rather than return to his booming hometown. 

He tells of workers who lost their footing or whose harness failed while building a bridge near his home town of Cizhong, 20 or 30 kilometers south. He pulls hard on his cigarette. "This river", he says, "has taken so many lives".

It has sustained many more. From trickles of meltwater in arid Qinghai, the river grows quickly as it passes through Tibet and Yunnan. Leaving China, and in doing so changing its name from the Lancang to the Mekong, it descends through a landscape ripening into jungle.

The Mekong region is Asia's rice bowl. The region boasts remarkable biodiversity; only the vast basins of the Congo and the Amazon compare to or surpass it.

Since its French colonial days the Mekong has been more of a backwater. And as modernity comes into this region, it also seeks to take something out. Countries see a new resource in the Mekong: not the support it offers rich networks of life, but the simple fact of its flow. The hydroelectric dams now built on and planned for the Mekong amount to one of the largest-ever interventions in a river's course.

In teaching his students that change was the one true constant, the philosopher Heraclitus told them that no one ever steps in the same river twice. At the second step both man and river are not what they once were. In space and in time, from narrow gorges to salty seas and from great empires to impoverished peasantry, the river at Mr Guo's feet encompasses more change than most. These new developments, though, feel like something more profound. Flow means change, but it also brings identity, because ti embodies continuity. As the river is stilled, precious identities risk being lost for ever.
