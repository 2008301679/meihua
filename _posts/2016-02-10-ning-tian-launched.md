U.S. Supreme Court Blocks Obama's Clean Power Plan

Unusual 5-4 decision halts federal effort to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plant while the court battle continues.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday delivered a major blow to President Barack Obama by putting on hold federal regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions mainly from coal-fired power plants, the centerpiece of his administration's strategy to combat climate change.

The court voted 5-4 along ideological lines to grant a request by 27 states and various companies and business groups to block the administration's Clean Power Plan, which also mandates a shift to a renewable energy from coal-fired electricity.

The plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from U.S. power plants by 2030 to 32 percents below 2005 levels. It is the main tool for the United States to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged at U.N. climate talks in Paris in December.

The Supreme Court's action casts doubt on the long-term future of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's rule because it increases the chances that the conservative-leaning Supreme Court would take the case after a lower court issues a decision on the legality of the regulations and ultimately would strike it down.

For Obama, executing his climate change strategy would be a key legacy accomplishment as he nears the end of his time in office in January 2017.
