title: "Feeding the ten billion."

[source from <em>The Economist</em>][link]

Growing enough food for future generations will be a challenge. Hereâ€™s how to `meet` it.

One of the extraordinary things about the modern world is that so much of it takes food for granted. For most of recorded history, the `struggle` to eat has been `the main focus of human activity`, and all but a handful of people were either farmers or farm workers. Starvation was an `ever-present` threat. Even the best years rarely yielded much of `a surplus` to carry over as `an insurance against` leaner times. In the worst, none but the powerful could be sure of a full stomach.

The neo-Malthusians may throw up their hands in despair, but consider this: despite all the `apparent obstacles`, from yield plateaus to climate change, in the six years following the FAO analysis cereal production rose by 11%. If growth like that continues it should not only be possible to feed the 10 billion, but to feed them well.
