The Mekong: Fourth chapter: Fathers and sons

Chang Naa stands up on the prow of his narrow wooden canoe and casts a small net into the water under the watchful eyes of his son Chang Thung, a four-year-old as solid and sombre as his father is lithe and placid. Beneath the canoe's tattered fabric roof his wife stirs a pot of samlaa macchu, a sour soup. Before serving it she rinses the dishes in the murky water.

This worries everyone downstream. China and Thailand have long enjoyed good relations, and China has bought good will in Laos and Cambodia with massive infrastructure investments. By Myanmar has opened up to the West in the past five years in part to counterbalance Chinese influence. Vietnam fears its powerful northern neighbour-- China invaded as recently as 1979, and the two countries contest territory in the South China Sea--and anti-China sentiment has been rising in Laos. As China has grown more regionally assertive, Laos and Vietnam have sought to deepen their relations with America. Yet that will probably do very little to dissuade China from building more dams, any more than the objections of Lao's vastly richer and more populous neighbour Vietnam deterred it from building its dam at Xayaburi.
