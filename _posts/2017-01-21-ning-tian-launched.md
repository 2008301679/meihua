钢铁人，纸牌屋  
当选总统的团队需明白，美国经济不是一座钢铁厂

Iron man, paper room  
The president-elect team should understand that America is not a steel producing factory.

```
Men of steel, houses of cards  
The president elect’s team needs to realize that America’s economy is not like a steel mill.
```

特朗普一贯辩称全球化为美国带来的只是桩不划算的买卖。不过上述这种思路并没有问过这样一个问题：承蒙一个外国政府为自己提供了充足的廉价钢铁，这事是不是真的那么糟糕。消耗钢材的美国公司从中受益，它们利润增加进而雇用了更多的员工。更重要的是，大多数产品及服务的贸易都与钢铁贸易不同。美国从中国进口最多的是电机。中国政府并未向iPhone的过量生产提供补贴，随后大量投放市场的iPhone也没有造成在美国制造该手机的工人失业。实际上，一款智能手机也许在加州设计开发，在中国组装，使用六七个亚洲和欧洲国家制造或设计的部件以及来自非洲的金属。同样地，从墨西哥进口的每一美元的商品中就包含着美国约40美分的产值。对于这种商品的生产者来说，关税就意味着代价惨重的灾难。美国的钢铁企业也许得寻求政府的保护，但苹果及其同类则不会。

Trump always say that globalization is not a good deal for America. But it does not ask such a question: is it really bad when a foreign government can provide enough cheap steels. American companies who consume steels benefit from it. They have more profits and hire more employees. More important, trades of most products and services are different from that in steel. What the most America imports from China are electric motors. Chinese government does not provide bonuses for iPhone overproduction, and large quantities of iPhones in the market do not lead to the unemployment of workers who produce these cell phones in America. In fact, a smart cell phone may be developed in California, assembled in China, use components produced or designed in six or seven Asian and European countries as well as metals from Africa. Equally, each dollar of goods imported from Mexico includes forty cents belonging to America. For producers of such kind of products, taxes mean overpriced tragedy. American steel factories may need to ask for protection from the government, but the Apple and some others will not.

Mr Trump has consistently argued that globalization gives America a poor deal. Yet this way of thinking fails to deal with the question of whether an ample supply of cheap steel courtesy of a foreign government is really so terrible: it benefits American firms that consume steel-and they earn bigger profits and employ more people as a result. Moreover, trade in most goods and services is not like steel. America’s biggest import from China is electrical machinery. China’s government does not subsidize the overproduction of iPhones which are then dumped on the market, causing iPhone-makers in America to be laid-off. Instead, a smartphone might be designed and engineered in California and assembled in China, using components made or designed in half a dozen Asian and European countries, using metals from Africa. Likewise, every dollar of Mexican exports contains around forty cents of American output embedded within it. For producers of such goods, tariffs would be a costly disaster. American steelmakers might seek out government protection. Apple and its kind will not.
