Falling towards Hillary

Even among her supporters, there was no great enthusiasm in Iowa for Mrs Clinton.

Of the checks on executive power in the constitution, perhaps the least needed is the amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Americans often invest sky-high hopes in those they send to the White House, choosing someone they believe will correct the flaws of a now-despised predecessor. After their first terms, presidents seeking re-election are frequently helped by the trappings of office. But after eight years the mood sours: Americans then long for change, and for someone younger, more competent or less mired in scandal.

Mrs Clinton has "been around so long, you sort of get fatigued", conceded Catherine Rod, a wavering voter at the caucus. 

Lots of Democrats feel similarly trapped. They have only one plausible general-election candidate, Mrs Clinton, and understand why lots of American are unexcited by her. Assuming that she survives her latest legal woes involving classified e-mails, Mrs Clinton will be the nominee. But Iowa was an early warning. A long, grinding slog awaits.
