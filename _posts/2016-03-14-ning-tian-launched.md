The future of computing

The era of predictable improvement in computer hardware is ending. What comes next?

In 1971 the fastest car in the world was the Ferrari Daytona, capable of 280kph. The world's tallest buildings were New York's twin towers, at 415 meters. In November that year Intel launched the first commercial microprocessor chip, the 4004, containing 2,300 tiny transistors, each the size of a red blood cell. 

Since then chips have improved in line with the prediction of Gordon Moore. According to his rule of thumb, known as Moore's law, processing power doubles every two years as smaller transistors are packed ever more tightly onto silicon wafers, boosting performance and reducing costs. This exponential progress is difficult to relate to the physical world. If cars and skyscrapers had improved at such rates since 1971, the fastest car would now be capable of a tenth of the speed of light; the tallest building would reach half way to the Moon.

The impact of Moore's law is visible all around us. But now, after five decades, the end of Moore's law is in sight. The future of computing will be defined by improvements in three other areas, beyond raw hardware performance. The first is software. The second era of progress is in the "cloud", the networks of data centers that deliver services over the internet. The third era of improvements lies in new computing architectures--specialized chips optimized for particular jobs, say, and even exotic techniques that exploit quantum-mechanical weirdness to crunch multiple data sets simultaneously.   

For companies, the end of Moore's law will be disguised by the shift to cloud computing. For the technology industry itself, the decline of Moore's law strengthens the logic for centralised cloud computing, already dominated by a few big firms: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. 

For more than 50 years, the seemingly inexorable shrinking of transistors made computers steadily cheaper and more capable. As Moore's law fades, progress will be less metronomic. But computers and other devices will continue to become more powerful--just in different and more varied ways.
