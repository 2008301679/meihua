[source from <em>The Economist</em>][link]


Microsoft’s free upgrade to its latest operating system `is about to` expire.

That is not necessarily true for Windows 7. `Over the years since its release in 2009`, Windows 7’s robustness, user friendliness and low maintenance cost have made it a `firm favorite` among PC users, especially those in business. Four years after it was officially replaced, `the old workhorse` continues to run on over 50% of all Windows PCs, while fewer than 15% use Windows 8/8.1, according to data collected by Net Applications, a web-analytics firm in Aliso Viejo, California. `By contrast`, Windows 10 currently accounts for around 17% of PCs in the Windows family, many of which were bought `over the past year` with the latest operating system pre-installed.
