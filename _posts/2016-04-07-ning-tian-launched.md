Imperial ambitions

Mark Zuckerberg prepares to fight for dominance of the next era of computing.

Not since the era of imperial Rome has the "thumb-up" sign been such a potent and public symbol of power. A mere 12 years after it was founded, Facebook is a great empire with a vast population, immense wealth, a charismatic leader, and mind-boggling reach and influence. The world's largest social network has 1.6 billion users, a billion of whom use it every day for an average of over 20 minutes each. In the Western world, Facebook accounts for the largest share of the most popular activity; its various apps accounts for 30% of mobile internet by Americans. And it is the sixth-most-valuable public company on Earth, worth some $325 billion.

...

Striking a balance between becoming ever more intimately entwined in billions of people's lives, making huge profits as a result and avoiding a backlash will be one of the biggest business challenges of the country. Even in ancient Rome, emperors could find that the crowd suddenly turned against them. So applaud Mr Zukerberg--and fear for him, too.
