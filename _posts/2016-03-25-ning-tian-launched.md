Chronicle of a death foretold

Why China must adapt or die?

Every few years a high-profile commentator gains fame and sometimes shame by predicting the imminent disintegration of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1989 many China-watchers disagreed only on whether it would take weeks or months for the Communist Party to crumble after it ordered government troops--the People's Liberation Army--to crush the people's liberation. 

A year ago, David Shambaugh, an American political scientist, fired his opening shot as the new doomsayer, with a provocative opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal: "The Coming Chinese Crackup".

His new book, "China's Future", elaborates this view. Mr Shambaugh has long argued that China is less powerful than many people think and that this makes its future "one of the key global uncertainties over the coming decades". The concern is partly about an economy that is so central to the global one. But China's trajectory also raises a bigger question: no country has yet been able to modernise its economy without becoming a democracy. Can China break the model?

His bald conclusion is "no". China today is more repressive than at any time since the early 1990s, says Mr Shambaugh, bringing the country close to falling apart. The political system is "badly broken" and the wealthy elite have lost confidence in it. 

From the 1950s onwards China has been beset by political oscillations, with occasional periods of opening up followed by phases of tightened control. Looking forward, the author declares that China now faces a choice: reform or die. Ultimately, he reckons, it will stick to its current course of "hard authoritarianism", corroding the party's ability to govern, constraining economic progress and stifling innovation. All societies face a "revolution of rising expectations" as they get richer, he notes, but for autocratic governments like China's, these pose an existential threat.

In the end, Mr Shambaugh cnanot decide whether the coming crackup will be led by the party or the people. The party commands its own destiny. But he also lists a catalogue of credible threats form within society, including tensions over pensions, health care and the environment: ‚Äù At some point, some--or several--of the elements...will 'snap'," he reckons. Hong Kong, Tibet and the far western province of Xinjiang are all tinderboxes, with the fuses already burning.

This sweep is both the book's strength and weakness: by Mr Shambaugh's telling, China's problems are so many, various and deep that it does indeed seem impossible that the Communist Party can survive. Yet it raises the opposite question too: what, then, has held such an improbable regime together for so long?
