How to be a critic in an age of opinion

Orwell had just published "Animal Farm," written while he was working as a critic. It was perhaps, the most prolific period of his career: from 1943 to 1944 alone, he reviewed more than eighty books for the Tribune. Yet those efforts must now rank among his least-read work. "The prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job," he wrote in the same essay. No honest hack could compose so quickly and from such weak grounding without shame. Orwell's consolation, as a literary critic, was that he could have been something worse. "Everyone in this world has someone else whom he can look down on," he explained, "and I must say, from experience of both trades, that the book reviewer is better off than the film critic, who cannot even do his work at home."

"I can't name three first-rate literary critics in the United States," Gore Vidal, who worked as one constantly, said. In recent years, film reviewers have increasingly been turned out among the ranks of the unemployed. Everybody likes a movie critic; no one, it seems, needs one. If you went to see the new "Star Wars" installment, it probably wasn't because of the writeup in your Thursday paper. If your local critic cast a no vote on "Carol," you could find a friend to set you straight. Even friendless people can use Google. Run an online search, and you will tumble down a wishing well of user comments, aggregated user comments, and blogs by tax accountants with free evenings. 

What's the point of a reviewer in an age when everyone reviews? A common defense of the endeavor centers on three qualities: expertise, eloquence, and attention. Critics have essential skills that Blogging Bob does not. They know more. They are decent writers, who can give a fair encapsulation of a work and detail their responses. And they're focused: since their job is studying and explaining the object at hand, they are especially alert to its nuances.

This case, unfortunately, doesn't hold up in the age of Yelp. Professional critics are knowledgeable, sure. But amateurs are hardly less so: film buffs have enjoyed easy access to their canon since the V.H.S era. Reviewers write with skill, but so do lots of tax-accountant bloggers. What are the professionals doing for us today?

A.O.Scott, a film critic of the Times, has come to lead what sometimes seems the earth's last sovereign generation of mainstream reviewers. He wonders, "Will it sound defensive or pretentious if I say that criticism is an art in its own right?"

It does sound a little defensive, though one understands the impulse. Critics justifying their trade like to say that the judgement aspect of the job--the thumbs-up or thumbs-down--is the least interesting part: really, they just love movies or whatever it is they review. This sounds a little like a butcher claiming to have gone into the meat-slicing business because he likes working with animals. It is possible to honor and enjoy new work without grading and dissecting it. That is how many people live. 

Scott recalls that he faced accusations of bad faith in writing about "The Avengers," in the spring of 2012. He didn't hate the movie, but he was irked by what he saw as its over-processed, profit-seeking slickness. When the review appeared, Samuel L. Jackson, one of the film's many stars, singled him out on Twitter("AO Scott needs a new job!...One he can ACTUALLY do!"), and fans piled on. "The Avengers" went on to be one of the fastest movies ever to gross a billion dollars.

What valuable function did Scott's review serve in this case? It certainly didn't talk moviegoers out of seeing or enjoying the film. It didn't persuade the film's producers to change course. What such reviews do is to contribute to a climate in which creative work is taken seriously, and thus dignified as a pursuit. "It is my contention here that criticism, far from sapping the vitality of art, is instead what supplies its lifeblood; that criticism, properly understood, is not an enemy from which art must be defended, but rather another name--the proper name--for the defense of art itself," he writes. Criticism sets a standard that artists can strive for or resist, he says, echoing an old defense by the poet-critic Matthew Arnold. According to Scott, "A work of art is itself a piece of criticism."
