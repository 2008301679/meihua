Hillary Clinton courts the black vote in Chicago and New York

After a resounding defeat by Bernie Sanders in the primaries on New Hampshire and only a razor-thin victory in the caucuses in Iowa, two largely white states, Hilary Clinton is doubling down on her courtship of black and Hispanic voters. 

Mrs Clinton was endorsed by the Congressional black caucus and many other black leaders. Mr Sanders so far has mainly managed to get backing from black intellectuals such as Cornel West, the Princeton professor, Michelle Alexander, a legal scholar, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, a writer. But Mr Sanders continues to push his surprisingly effective campaign.
