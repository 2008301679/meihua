title: "America issues a travel alert covering Europe."

[source from <em>The Economist</em>][link]


Yesterday, the United States issued a travel alert aimed at `those` thinking of visiting Europe, `warning` them `of` the risk of potential terrorist attacks “`throughout`” the continent. On the face of it this seems odd. No one denies that the threat of terrorism this side of the pond is real. France is still operating under a state of emergency `following` the attacks in Paris earlier this year. It `will soon` host the European football championship, the world’s `third-biggest` sporting event `after` the World Cup and the Olympics. Few doubt about that terror groups have a beady eye on the event—least of all France itself, `which` is deploying 90,000 `police, soldiers and security guards` to watch out the tournament.
