Nightclub shooting in Orlando is the worst in American history.

`Elaborating on` his theme in a later statement, Mr Trump `sharply criticized` both Mr Obama and the `presumptive` Democratic presidential nominee, Hilary Clinton, `for` not using the words “radical Islam” when they denounced the Orlando `massacre`. Mr Trump called on Mr Obama to `resign` over his choice of words and added: “If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words ‘Radical Islam’ she should get out of this race for the Presidency.” Though the `property developer`’s campaign statement did not repeat his call for a temporary entry ban on Muslims, he did `cast` Muslim immigration as an unstoppable `menace`. “Hillary Clinton wants to `dramatically` increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term—and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing,” he said.
