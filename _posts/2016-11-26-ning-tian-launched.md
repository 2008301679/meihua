为什么工薪阶层孩子在学校都很用功学习 却很少获得顶尖工作

Why the children from families with normal salaries work hard at school but few earn top salaries

```
Why are working class kids less likely to get elite jobs? They study too hard at college.
```

劳伦·里韦拉是美国西北大学凯洛格商学院工商管理与社会机构专业的副教授。她在最近发表的著作中提“血统如何使精英学生获得顶尖工作”，”研究了教育水平，日常技能还有强大的政治经济能力如何使微妙社会结构产生巨大的差距。我还就她的著作提出了四个问题。

Lauren is an associate professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of management. Her recent book, “Pedigree: How Elite Students Get Elite Jobs,” examines how inequality is produced by subtle social patterns of education and informal skills as well as big political and economic forces. I asked her four questions about the book.

Lauren is an associate professor from Management and Social Facility Department of Business School at the Northwestern University. She proposed a question “how can the background make elite students find top jobs” in her latest book. In that book, she studied how the education level, daily skills, and strong political and economic capability make great differences on fragile social structure. And I would ask four questions based on her book.

当社会学家在思考贫富差距问题，思考着精英阶层如何把他们的优势传给下一代时，经常会争论，他们认为这是由明显的实质性差异所驱使的，例如精英阶层就能去好学校上学。您书中提到，精英特权能提供一些不可言说的好处，能帮到某些特殊的学生，让他们在数一数二的律师事务所，银行和管理咨询公司上班，而其他人就没那种待遇了。给他们的好处到底是什么？

When sociologists think about issues of the poor and the wealth and how the elite class transfer their advantage to the next generation, they often have debates and they believe that these issues are propelled by the substantially obvious differences. For instance, children from the elite class can go to good school. In your book, the elite priority can provide many wonderful advantages, and help some certain special students to work in the top lawyer offices, banks, and management consult companies, while quite a different story for many others. What the hell are the advantages?

```
When sociologists think about economic inequality and the ways in which elites are able to hand down advantages to their kids, they usually argue that it’s driven by obvious material differences, such as access to good schools. Your book argues that elite privilege can involve subtle benefits that help some students - and not others - get jobs at top ranked law firms, banks, and management consultancies. What are these benefits?

不管是否有意为之，精英阶层的父母让孩子享有不同的体验和互动方式，这对在社会上获得成功是有益的。在上层阶级和中上层阶级圈子里，有很多都是理所应当的事。例如，怎么准备大学申请书（培养那些能给招生负责人留有印象的正确类型的成就和造诣），如何在商业的场合中以一种自然的方式交际，如何与老师，面试官还有其他的信息传递者保持融洽的关系，从有权力的人那里获得你想要的东西。大体上，如果我们把贫富差距看作一场体育竞赛，精英阶层的父母使他们的孩子处于上风，不仅仅是能够提供必要的游戏装备，还能教授他们游戏的规则，提供一些赢得比赛的内部秘诀。

No matter on purpose or not, the elites can help their children enjoy different experience and interactions, which is quite helpful to be succeed in society. For the upper and middle class, many things are quite normal. For example, how to prepare the university application (to cultivate the capabilities and achievement which can impress the recruiters), how to make natural conversations with others in business occasions, how to make great contact with teachers and recruiters , and how to get what you want from the people in authorities. Generally, if we treat the difference between the wealth and the poor as a competition, the elites can make their children at an advantage position. They cannot only provide them with necessary equipment, but also teach them rules and ticks for winning the game.

```
Whether intentionally or not, elite parents expose their children to different experiences and styles of interacting that are useful for getting ahead in society. Many of these are taken for granted in upper and upper-middle class circles, such as how to prepare a college application (and having cultivated the right accomplishments to impress officers), how to network in a business setting in a way that seems natural, and how to develop rapport with teachers, interviewers, and other gatekeepers to get things you want from those in power. Basically, if we think of economic inequality as a sporting competition, elite parents give their kids a leg up, not only by being able to afford the equipment necessary to play but also by teaching them rules of the game and giving them insider tips on how to win.
