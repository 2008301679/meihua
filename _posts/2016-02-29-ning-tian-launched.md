The legacy of Pokemon for millennials

If 2016 is the year of monkey, it surly belongs to its more famous animated cousin, Mankey. On February 27th, millions celebrated 20 years since the birth of Pokemon, a series conceived by Satoshi Tajiri, a video-game designer, in 1996 on the back of Gameboy's successful worldwide launch in 1989. His idea was simple and extensive; an animation following the adventures of a young go-getter, Ash Ketchum, and his friends as they set about collecting creatures in a bid to enter tournaments and understand the infinite animal kingdom of pocket monsters. Celebrating 20 continuous years is a worthy milestone. Pokemon brought endless riches to those--including your correspondent--who grew up during a Japanese breakout in 1990s.

Ask millennials about their childhood or teenage years and many will surely scream Pokemon until yellow in the face. Pokemon transformed the way in which millennials identify with their place in the world. What started as a Japanese-centric cartoon--a boy leaving home to traverse richer, urban climbs in the search for better prospects--resonated beyond Asia to all manner of families, rich and poor alike.

Pokemon may not reach quite its zenith of the late 1990s and early 2000s again, but it has a place in the heart of global community. It celebrates adventure, instant data, and diverse friendships--including that with your enslaved pet. It perfected the craze for Manga and mainstream gaming into a perfect product both off-screen and on-screen. A moment in time when America and Europe transfixed its gaze on all things Japanese--Pokenmon, Hello Kitty, Tamgotchi--and predicted the future with its technology. That is some feat for a 20-year old polyplot institution, trying to catch 'em all.
