The last days of the stick man of Chongqing

Yu Xiaoyan waits for work in the rain, sitting on a bamboo pole near the center of Chongqing, a large city in the south-west. A wiry 60-year-old with salt-and-pepper hair, a wispy beard and an air of resignation, he muses:"I've been here for 20 years, and it's never been so tough." He is what locals call a bangbang man.

The bangbang brigade is unique to Chongqing and an emblem of the city. In 2014 when Li Keqiang, the prime minister, paid a visit, he called the bangbang men "a symbol of the Chinese people's hard-working spirit".

But the trade is dying. When roads were unpaved and buildings lacked lifts, brawn was the only way to move goods up and down the steep hills and into tower blocks. But with better roads and more modern buildings, that is no longer true. Delivery companies with young men on motorcycles have taken over and the remaining bangbang men are coming to terms with modern technology. They have set up an instant-messaging group to parcel out the available jobs. 

"Most people are going back to their villages," Xiaoyan says. He turns to write his name, using a finger to draw characters on the wet marble whether he sits; the rain soon washes them away.
