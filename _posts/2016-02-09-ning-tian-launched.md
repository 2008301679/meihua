Only China can stop North Korea from becoming a full nuclear power

China remains quiet despite Kim Jong-Un's agression.

It is hard to see what might deflect North Korea from becoming a fully-fledged nuclear power. On February 7th it fired an Unha-3 satellite launch rocket into space, just one month after the test of a nuclear device that the North claimed, somewhat unconvincingly, was a hydrogen bomb. The expressions of outrage from the international community and regional neighbours, particularly Japan and South Korea, were the same then as now. The UN Security Council duly held an emergency meeting. America's secretary of state, John Kerry, repeated his calls for additional international sanctions against North Korea, which were rejected by the rogue state's only supposed ally, China.

...

The current situation is not without cost for China. It is embarrassing for it to have so little influence over the actions of its smaller neighbour. It will also regard with alarm America's willingness to improve South Korea's anti-missile defences. America says that THAAD will only be focused on the threat from North Korea, but the Chinese fear that, if integrated with systems operated by Japan and America, it would undercut the effectiveness of its own missile forces.

China is not ready to call Mr Kim to heel, however. Perhaps another reason it may be reluctant to try is that it is not sure that he would comply.
