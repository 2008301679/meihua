The tourism-dependent `nation` rarely provides clarity in cases of murdered foreigners.

`Hours after` a Russian airliner—Metrojet flight 9268—crashed in the Sinai Peninsula last October, killing 224 people, the Egyptian affiliate of Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility. Less than a week later, Britain said it suspected that a bomb was the cause. American officials `concurred`, `fingering` IS. Two weeks after that, Russia concluded that a “`terror act`” brought down the plane. `Case closed, it seemed`.

But Egypt dismissed each suggestion as a premature. In December its investigators `issued` a preliminary report stating that there was no evidence of terrorist activity or a security failure. They still have not produced a final report (publicly, at least). Only in February did Egypt’s president, Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, obliquely admit that the crash was an act of terrorism.
