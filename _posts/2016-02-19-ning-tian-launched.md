Britain's negotiations in Brussels are proving trickier than planned

With European leaders digging their heels in, the chance of an agreement by the end of the day is at best even.

David Cameron's plan for the European Union summit on February 18th and 19th was simple enough. There would be a short squabble with the east Europeans over benefits for EU migrants to Britain, a quick battle with the French over protections for countries not in the euro and a brief row with Belgium over "ever closer union", all of them designed to show that the prime minister was "battling for Britain".

Yet like so many plans, this one did not survive first contact with the enemy. The east Europeans dug in their heels over the length of time that in-work benefits could be denied to EU migrants, and over plan to curb child benefits even for those already drawing them.

Yet in the end EU leaders know they will have to give Mr Cameron enough concessions to allow him to claim to his party and voters that his renegotiation has been a success if he is to have a chance of winning his referendum. They recognise that a Britain decision to leave would not just be a risk for Britain but also a heavy blow to the EU and its standing in the world. Opinion polls show that, however annoying many political leaders around Europe may find Mr Cameron and his demands, their voters want Britain to stay in. So a deal will be done: but it may come later than the British prim minister planned.
