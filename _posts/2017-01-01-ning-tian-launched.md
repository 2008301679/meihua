模范少数族裔  
印度人如何在美国获得成功  
20世纪初，每年只有几百人从印度移民美国，生活在美国的印度裔仅有5000人左右。但这个数字对一些仇外人士来说已经不少了。一个政府委员会在1910年得出结论：印度人是“最不受欢迎的亚洲人”，且美国西海岸的公民“一致希望驱逐他们”。

A model minority  
How do Indians make success in America?  
In the start of 20 century, only hundreds of Indians immigrated to America every year, and there were only around 5,000 Indian-American in America. But it was a big number to the people who hated foreigners. One government committee drawn a conclusion in 1910 that Indians were the most unwelcome Asians, and citizens in the west coast agreed and hoped to expel them.

A model minority  
How Indians triumphed in America?  
In the early 20th century just a few hundred people emigrated from India to America each year and there were only about 5,000 folk of Indian heritage living in the United States. That was more than enough for some xenophobes. One government commission in 1910 concluded that Indians were the most undesirable of all Asiatics and that citizens of America’s west coast were unanimous in their desire for exclusion.

今天，出生于印度的美国人有200万，他们可能是美国最成功的少数族裔。与其他所有生于外国的主要族裔相比，他们更年轻、更富有，已婚比例更高，并受过极好的教育。在西海岸，他们是硅谷的一股强大力量，而在纽约周边也聚集着富有的印度人。《另外百分之一》（The Other One Percent）是对这种转变的由来所做的第一项大型研究，充满了详实的分析，在这个被严重忽略的课题上尽显权威。

Today there are 200 million Indians born in America, and they may be the most successful minorities in the United States. Compared with all the other main peoples born in foreign countries, they are younger, wealthier, have higher married rates and well educated. In the west coast, they are a flow of powerful strength. Surrounding New York, there are also many wealthy Indians residents. The Other One Percent is the first large research on the reason behind such transmission. It is fulfilled with detailed analysis and shows great authorities in this severely overlooked topic.

Today Indian-born Americans number 2m and they are probably the most successful minority group in the country. Compared with all the other big foreign-born groups, they are younger, richer and more likely to be married and supremely well educated. On the west coast they are a mighty force; well-off Indians cluster around New York, too. “The Other One Percent” is the first major study of how this transformation happened. Filled with crunchy analysis, it exudes authority on a hugely neglected subject.

与所有移民群体一样，印度人在美国庞大的经济中找到了自己的位置。 美国的汽车旅馆有一半为印度人所有，他们主要来自古吉拉特邦。来自旁遮普地区的印度人则经营着洛杉矶大多数的7-Eleven加盟便利店和赛百味三明治店。印度人涌入美国的浪潮也与科技产业的兴起密切相关。20世纪80年代，印度放松了对私立大学的规定，使得理工科毕业生人数激增。 20世纪90年代后期对“千年虫”的恐惧推动这些毕业生融入全球经济——大批的印度工程师要么在次大陆远程工作，要么持工作签证前往美国，以确保在1999年12月31日午夜时钟敲响时计算机不会瘫痪。

The same with all immigration groups, Indians find their place in America’s huge economy. Half of motels in America are owned by Indians mainly from XXX, while Indians from XXX run most of the 7-11 restores and Subways in Los Angles. That Indians pour into America is also related with emerging technology industry. In 1980s India loosed the rein over Individual University, which led to a sharp increase in the number of graduates in math and science.  In the late 1990s fears of “Thousand-Year Bug” propelled these graduates into global economy—large quantities of Indian technicians chose to work in sub mainland or go to America with job visa to make sure that computers would not crash when bell ringed on the eve of December 31 in 1999.

Like all immigrant groups, Indians have found niches in America’s vast economy. Half of all motels are owned by Indians, mainly Gujaratis. Punjabis dominate the franchise for 7-eleven stores and Subway sandwiches in Los Angeles. The surge in Indians moving to America is also intimately linked to the rise of the technology industry. In the 1980s India loosened its rules on private colleges, leading to a large expansion in the pool of engineering and science graduates.  Fear of the “Y2K” bug in the late 1990s served as a catalyst for them to engage with the global economy, with armies of Indian engineers working remotely from the subcontinent, or travelling to America on worker’s visas, to make sure computers did not fail at the stroke of midnight on December 31 1999.

但作者确实触及了一个最引人深思的问题：这些光鲜的印度移民是如何影响印度本国的。美印两大民主国家之间的外交关系长期以来一直颇为紧张。但在其他领域，两国间的联系已越来越紧密。那些在美国社会里地位崇高的印度名人在印度国内就和板球大师及宝莱坞美女等完全非美国的形象一样受到追捧。印度政界精英的孩子在美国接受教育，很可能是他们在1991年帮助推动了印度经济的开放。印度大型科技公司在美国所获的数百亿美元收入对印度的国际收支也至关重要。过去五年里引领印度电子商务蓬勃发展的新一代企业家几乎都受过美国的教育，或在美国科技公司工作过。

But the author did touch a most reflecting question: how these glowing immigrants influence India itself. The diplomatic relationship between democratic America and India have been quite tense in a long time. But connections in other fields have become more and more intimate. Those Indian elites with high social status in America can gain popular pursuits in India just like these totally un-American figures like bracket ball masters and Baollywood beauties. Indian political elites’ children got educated in America, who probably helped propel the economy’s opening in 1991. Billions of dollars earned by large Indian technology companies from America are important to India’s international balances. Almost all the enterprisers leading the great development of India’s electric business in the past five years were ever educated in America or worked in America’s technology companies.

```
But the authors do touch on the most fascinating question of all: how this gilded corner of the diaspora influences India itself. Diplomatic relations between the two giant democracies have long been testy. But in other realms the bond has grown closer. The stars at the pinnacle of American society are celebrated back in India alongside rather un-American figures such as spin-bowling masters and Bollywood maidens. The American-educated children of India’s governing elite probably helped push India to open up its economy in 1991. The tens of billions of dollars of income earned in America by India’s big technology firms is crucial for its balance of payments. And a new generation of entrepreneurs who have led a boom in e-commerce in India are almost all American educated, or have worked for American technology firms.
