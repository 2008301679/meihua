Million-dollar babies

As Silicon Valley fights for talent, universities struggle to hold on to their stars.

That a computer program can repeatedly beat the world champion at Go, a complex board game, is a coup for the fast-moving field of artificial intelligence (AI). Another high-stakes game, however, is taking place behind the scenes, as firms compete to hire the smartest AI experts. Technology giants, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Baidu, are racing to expand their AI activities.

In the past universities employed the world's best AI experts. Now tech firms are plundering departments of robotics and machine leaning from the highest-flying faculty and students, luring them with big salaries similar to those fetched by professional athletes. Last year Uber, a taxi-hailing firm, recruited 40 of the 140 staff of the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University, and set up a unit to work on self-driving cars.That drew headlines because Uber had earlier promised to fund research at the center before deciding instead to peel off its staff. Other firms seek talent more quietly but just as doggedly.

Experts in machine learning are most in demand. Big tech firms use it in many activities, from basic tasks such as spam-filtering and better targeting of online advertisements, to futuristic endeavors such as self-driving cars or scanning images to identify disease.  

Tech firms have not always lavished such attention and resources on AI experts. The field was largely ignored and underfunded during the "AI winter" of the 1980s and 1990s, when fashionable approaches to AI failed to match their early promise. The present machine-learning boom began in earnest when Google started doing deals focused on AI. In 2014, for example, it bought DeepMind, the startup behind the computer's victory in Go, from researchers in London. 

The firms offer academics the chance to see their ideas reach markets quickly, which many like. Andrew Ng, who leads AI research for the Chinese internet giant Baidu and used to teach full-time at Stanford, says tech firms offer two especially appealing things: lots of computing power and large data sets. Both are essential for modern machine learning.

All that is to the good, but the hiring spree could also impose costs. One is that universities, unable to offer competitive salaries, will be damaged if too many bright minds are either lured away permanently or distracted from the lecture hall by commitments to tech firms. Whole countries could suffer, too.

Another risk is if expertise in Al is concentrated disproportionately in a few firms, Tech companies make public some of their research through open source. In practice, however, many profitable findings are not shared. Some worry that Google, the leading firm in the field, could establish something close to an intellectual monopoly. It is similar to the concentration of talented scientists who laboured on the Manhattan Project, which produced America's atom bomb.

Whether tech firms, rather than universities, are best placed to deliver general progress in AI is up for debate. Andrew Moore, the dean of Carnegie Mellon University's computer-science department, worries that the potential for a "seed corn" problem: that universities could one day lack sufficient staff to produce future crops of researchers. As bad, with fewer people doing pure academic research, sharing ideas openly or working on projects with decades-long time horizons, future breakthroughs could also be stunted.

But such risks will not necessarily materialize. The extra money on offer in AI has excited new students to enter the field. And tech firms could help to do even more to develop and replace talent. Tech firms have the cash to do so, and the motivation. In Silicon Valley it is talent, not money, that is the scarcest resource.
