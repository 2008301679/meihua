Chinese property for whom the bubble blows

House prices are soaring in big cities, but oversupply plagues much of the country.

Shanghai, China's financial center, does not make it easy on outsiders wishing to buy homes. Non-residents who are single are banned from buying property. The married are welcome but only so long as they have paid local taxes for two years and make nearly a third of the purchase in cash. Shenyang, China's biggest northern city, is far more welcoming. Anyone can buy a home there. All to little effect: housing prices in Shanghai, five times expensive than those in Shenyang, have risen by 20% over the past year; those in the northern city have edged down.

This bifurcation is a worry for the government, which wants to spur growth without inflating bubbles. A divergence in housing prices between wealthy cities and the hinterland is a familiar problem in other countries. But the divisions are starker in China. In its most prosperous cities, already giddy prices continue to shoot up, while unsold flats pile up in markets where valuations were low to begin with. Moreover, construction has long been one of the economy's main engines, accounting for as much as a quarter of GDP growth until recently. This makes it especially important that the government gets the balance right. Doing so is proving hard.
