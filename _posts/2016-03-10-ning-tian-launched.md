Showdown

Win or lose, a computer program's contest against a professional Go player is another milestone in AI.

TWO : NIL to the computer. That was the score, in the latest round of the battle between artificial intelligence (AI) and the naturally evolved sort. The field of honour is a Go board in Seoul, South Korea--a country that cedes to no one, least of all its neighbour Japan, the title of most Go-crazy place on the planet. To the chagrin of many Japanese, who think of Go as theirs in the same way that the English think of crickets, the game's best player is generally reckoned to be Lee Sedol, a South Korean. But not, perhaps, for much longer. Mr Lee is in the middle of a five-game series with AlphaGo, a computer program written by researchers at DeepMind, an Al software house in London that was bought by Google in 2014. And, though it is not an official championship series, as the scoreline shows, Mr Lee is losing.

The rules of Go are simple and minimal. The players are Black and White, each provided with a bowl of stones of the appropriate colour. Black starts. Players take turns to place a stone on any occupied intersection of a 19by19 grid of vertical and horizontal lines. The aim is to use the stone to clarify territory. In the version being played by Mr Lee and AlphaGo each stone, and each surrounded intersection, is a point towards the final score. Stones surrounded by enemy stones are captured and removed. If an infinite loop of capture and recapture, known as Ko, becomes possible, a player is not allowed to recapture immediately, but must first play elsewhere. Play carries on until neither player wishes to continue. This simplicity, though, is deceptive.
