title: "Americans are increasingly addicted to opioids."
---

`The painkillers` are over-prescribed in America, but `a nightmare to obtain in much of the world`.

But in 1980s a series of papers by American researchers `claimed` that opioids `could` be used safely for longer periods. The `evidence` was `slight`, but, combined with a `formidable marketing effort by` drug firms, it `led to American doctors prescribing` opioids `with abandon` for chronic, non-terminal pain. According to America’s Centers for Disease Control (CDC), between 1994 and 2006 the share of American adults who had used prescription opioids in a given month `jumped` from 3.4% to `nearly` 7%. In 2012 doctors wrote 259m prescriptions for opioids—enough for a bottle each for every adult. Americans `guzzle` six times more prescription opioids per person than 20 years ago.
