What little babies see that you no longer can

Before developing perceptual constancy, three- to four-month-old babies have a striking ability to see image differences that are invisible to adults. They lose this superior skill around the age of five months.

Constancy illusions are adaptive: consider what would have happened if your ancestors thought a friend became a foe whenever a cloud hid the sun, or if they lost track of their belongings--and even their own children--every time they stepped out of the cave and into the sunlight. Why, they might have even eaten their own kids! You are here because the perceptual systems of your predecessors were resistant to annoying changes in physical reality--as is your own (adult) perception. 

The discrimination of surfaces is not the only domain where we abandon reality for illusion as we grow up. During the first year of life, infants suffer the loss of a myriad discriminatory powers: among them, the ability to distinguish speech sounds in languages other than spoken by their own families. Objective differences become subjective similitudes.
