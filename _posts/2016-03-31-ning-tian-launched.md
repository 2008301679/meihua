Beware the cult of Xi

"If our party can't even handle food-safety issues properly, and keeps on mishandling them, then people will ask whether we are fit to keep ruling China." So Xi Jinping warned officials in 2013, a year after he became the country's leader. It was a remarkable statement for the chief of a Communist Party that has always claimed to have the backing of "the people". Mr Xi rounded up tens of thousands of erring officials, waging a war on corruption of an intensity not seen since the party came to power in 1949. Many thought he was right to do so.

Today, however, China is enduring its biggest public-health scandal in years. Mr Xi's anti-graft war has often made little difference to ordinary people. Their life--and health--is still blighted by corruption. In recent days there have also been signs of discontent with Mr Xi among the elite: official media complaining openly about reporting restrictions, a prominent businessman attacking him on his microblog, a senior editor resigning in disgust.

Mr Xi has acquired more power than any Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. It was supposed to let him get things done. What is going wrong?

In fairness, Mr Xi was bound to meet with hostility. Many officials are angry because he has ripped up the compact by which they have operated and which said that they could line their pockets, so long as corruption was not flagrant and they did their job well. But Mr Xi has also found that the pursuit of power is all-consuming: it does not leave room for much else. Mr Xi is, one analyst says, "Chairman of Everything".

At the same time, he has flouted the party's ban on personality cults, introduced in 1982 to prevent another episode of Maoist madness. Official media are filled with fawning over "Uncle Xi" and his wife, Peng Liyuan, called "Mama Peng". There have been rumors recently that Mr Xi feels some of this has been going a bit far. Many would take that as a sign that the personality cult is little more than harmless fun. Mr Xi is no Mao, whose tyrannical nature and love of adulation were so great that he blithely led the country into the frenzy and violence of the Cultural Revolution. 
But Mr Xi does not need to be as extreme as Mao for his concentration of power to cause harm. He has been fighting dissent with even more ruthlessness than he has been waging war on graft. Not since the dark days after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 has there been such a sweeping crackdown on critics of the party. Internet censors have been busy deleting messages posted on social media by outraged citizens in response to the vaccine scandal. Yet this work is never-ending. Even now citizens are pushing back. With the help of the internet, no matter how heavily it is blocked and censored, their voices keep crying out.

By cracking down and puffing himself up, Mr Xi is neither buying himself security nor helping to keep China stable. He is providing neither the country with prosperity and freedom, nor reassuring the rest of the world with stability. Abroad, anxieties about him keep growing: his muscular efforts to assert control in the South China Sea have been driving countries across Asia closer to the American camp.

Earlier in Mr Xi's rule, observers had wondered whether, after establishing himself, he would turn to carrying out the reforms that he says he wants. But hopes are fading that a big reformist push will ever materialise. The task of preserving his power is a full-time job. 

In the past 66 years of Communist rule in China, the most troubled times have usually come about when tensions break out within the elite. Mr Xi's style of rule is only serving to stoke them. The more Mr Xi to fight off enemies using scare tactics and brute force, the more enemies he is likely to make.
