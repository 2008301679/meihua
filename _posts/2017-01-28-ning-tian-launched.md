军需补给线  
无需运输  
与其运送部件到战场，何不就地打印？  

No need for delivery  
Instead of sending components to the war field, why not print them directly?  


```
Military supply lines  
Having no truck with it  
Instead of shipping parts to battlefields, why not print them there?  
```

“外行谈战略，内行谈后勤。”这一军事准则的最新结果是，世界各地的武装部队已开始在前线采用3D打印技术。按需打印出坚实耐用的军用武器尚需时日（民用的已不成问题）。但如果只是更换破损的关键小零件（等于以前给马匹更换蹄铁），以此方式就地制造便极具潜力。要将替换部件通过漫长的补给链运往远方的舰船或基地可能需耗时数周。而且，如果战事正酣，这样的运输队正是诱人的袭击对象。然而，要邻近前线备存各类零件又不切实际。能适时按需制造最好不过。


Trump always say that globalization is not a good deal for America. But it does not ask such a question: is it really bad when a foreign government can provide enough cheap steels. American companies who consume steels benefit from it. They have more profits and hire more employees. More important, trades of most products and services are different from that in steel. What the most America imports from China are electric motors. Chinese government does not provide bonuses for iPhone overproduction, and large quantities of iPhones in the market do not lead to the unemployment of workers who produce these cell phones in America. In fact, a smart cell phone may be developed in California, assembled in China, use components produced or designed in six or seven Asian and European countries as well as metals from Africa. Equally, each dollar of goods imported from Mexico includes forty cents belonging to America. For producers of such kind of products, taxes mean overpriced tragedy. American steel factories may need to ask for protection from the government, but the Apple and some others will not.

Newcomers talk about strategies, and experts talk about supplies. The latest result of the military diploma is that armies around the world are starting applying 3D print technology in the frontier. There is still a long time before armies can print solid and robust military weapons on needs (no problem for civil goods). Yet this way of producing locally is of extremely high potential if only broken critical small components need renew (similar to changing feet iron for horses). It may take several weeks to deliver components to distant ships or basements through a long supply chain. Moreover, such delivery troops are exactly attractive targets when the war is severe. However, it is unrealistic to back up all kind of components near the frontier. To produce them in time and on needs is the best.
