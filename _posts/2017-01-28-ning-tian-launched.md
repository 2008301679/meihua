军需补给线  
无需运输  
与其运送部件到战场，何不就地打印？  

No need for delivery  
Instead of sending components to the war field, why not print them directly?  


```
Military supply lines  
Having no truck with it  
Instead of shipping parts to battlefields, why not print them there?  
```

“外行谈战略，内行谈后勤。”这一军事准则的最新结果是，世界各地的武装部队已开始在前线采用3D打印技术。按需打印出坚实耐用的军用武器尚需时日（民用的已不成问题）。但如果只是更换破损的关键小零件（等于以前给马匹更换蹄铁），以此方式就地制造便极具潜力。要将替换部件通过漫长的补给链运往远方的舰船或基地可能需耗时数周。而且，如果战事正酣，这样的运输队正是诱人的袭击对象。然而，要邻近前线备存各类零件又不切实际。能适时按需制造最好不过。


Newcomers talk about strategies, and experts talk about supplies. The latest result of the military diploma is that armies around the world are starting applying 3D print technology in the frontier. There is still a long time before armies can print solid and robust military weapons on needs (no problem for civil goods). Yet this way of producing locally is of extremely high potential if only broken critical small components need renew (similar to changing feet iron for horses). It may take several weeks to deliver components to distant ships or basements through a long supply chain. Moreover, such delivery troops are exactly attractive targets when the war is severe. However, it is unrealistic to back up all kind of components near the frontier. To produce them in time and on needs is the best.

“Amateurs talk strategy, and professionals talk logistics.” That military maxim’s latest consequence is the adoption by the world’s armed forces of three-dimensional printing on the front line. It will be a while before weapons robust enough for military use can be printed on demand (though civil ones can be). But if it is a question of replacing a small but crucial component that has broken-the modern equivalent of reshoeing a horse-then making what is needed to order in this way has huge potential. Moving replacement parts through a long supply chain to a far-flung ship or base can take weeks. And, if a war is on, such convoys make tempting targets. Yet it is unrealistic to keep a full range of spares near the front line. Far better to produce what is needed, when it is needed.
