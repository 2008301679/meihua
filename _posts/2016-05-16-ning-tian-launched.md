It was the worst of times

China is still in denial about its "spiritual holocaust".

In February 1970 a 16-year-old boy, Zhang Hongbing, denounced his mother to an army officer in his village in Anhui province, in eastern China. He slipped a note under the officer's door accusing her of criticizing the Cultural Revolution and its leader, Mao Zedong. She was bound, publicly beaten and executed. Decades later Mr Zhang began writing a blog about the tragedy, seeking to clear his mother's name and to explain how her death happened. "I want to make people in China think," he wrote in April. "How could there be such a horrifying tragedy of ... a son sending his mother to execution? And how can we prevent it from happening again?" Mr Zhang suffers recurrent nightmares about his mother. So does China about the Cultural Revolution.
