Obama urges "a better politics" during a visit to a historic spot

On a freezing morning on February 10th 2007, Barack Obama declared his intention to run for the presidency on the steps of the old state capitol in Illinois, the very place where Abraham Lincoln gave his "A House Divided" speech against slavery 150 years earlier. His bid for the White House was a long shot: the young senator from Illinois was relatively young, unknown and inexperienced. America had never elected a black president. In Hillary Clinton, an experienced, well-known insider, Mr Obama was facing a formidable opponent. 

Nine years later, on an equally icy morning on February 10th, Mr Obama came back to Springfield, the second term of his presidency now coming to an end. He returned to his old stomping ground, according to the White House, to reflect on "what we can do, together, to build a better politics -- one that reflects our better selves". In 2007 Mr Obama proclaimed loftily that "this campaign must be [...] the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams [...] This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change". Today, he admits the meaning of citizenship has drifted further from the founder's vision since 2007. He calls his failure to heal the deep divisions in American politics one of the few regrets of his presidency.

"We can't move forward if all we do is to tear each other down. And the political incentives ... too often reward that kind of behavior," he said. Returning to Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, who was in his view America's greatest president, Mr Obama recalled that "a house divided against itself cannot stand" and "this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free". It was a fitting coda for a plea for unity, mutual respect and at least a modicum of civility.
