当教育跟不上技术进步时，就会造成不平等。在创新到来之际，工人如果没有技能使自己对雇主仍然“有用”，他们就会遭殃。而如果落后的工人太多，社会就开始崩塌。这一根本性的洞见极大影响了工业革命时期的改革者，推动了国家资助全民教育的普及。后来，工厂和办公室自动化又引发了大学生人数猛增。教育和创新相辅相成，历经数十年，令繁荣之花耀眼绽放。

When the education cannot catch up with the technology advances, it will produce the inequality. On the eve of the innovation, if workers do not have skills still helpful for their employers, they will be suffered.  If there are too many workers left behind, the society will start to collapse. This fundamental insight greatly influenced reformers in the Industry Revolutionary, and propelled the country to finance the popularization of the public education. Later, factories and office autonomy triggered the surge in the number of college students. Education and innovation relied on each other for tens of years, which made the flower of prosperity bloom and glow.

When education fails to keep pace with technology, the result is inequality. Without the skills to stay useful as innovations arrive, workers suffer-and if enough of them fall behind, society starts to fall apart. That fundamental insight seized reformers in the Industrial Revolution, heralding state-funded universal schooling. Later, automation in factories and offices called forth a surge in college graduates. The combination of education and innovation, spread over decades, led to a remarkable flowering of prosperity.
