American Demagogue

Nearly three decades ago, Howard Kaminsky, of Random House, called on the real-estate developer and self-marketing master Donald Trump at his office on Fifth Avenue. Kaminsky brought along a cover design for "Trump: The Art of the Deal," its author's literary debut. Trump seemed reasonably happy. Just one thing, he said. "Please make my name much bigger."

It was so funny once. For a long time, Trump, with his twenty-four-karat skyscrapers, his interesting hair, and his extra-classy airline, was a leading feature of the New York egoscape. But now, he means to command the United States armed forces and control its nuclear codes. He intends to propose legislation, conduct American's global affairs, preside over its national-intelligence apparatus, and make the innumerable moral and political decisions required of a President. This is not a Seth Rogen movie; this is as real as mud. Having all but swept the early Republican primaries and caucuses, Trump is getting ever closer to becoming the nominee of what Republicans like to call "the party of Abraham Lincoln". No American demagogue--not Huey Long, not Joseph McCathy, not George Wallace--has ever achieved such proximity to national power. As yet, no detestable remark, no flagrant display of ignorance, no scummy business deal has dissuaded his followers. Nor will Trump be defeated by the putatively scathing critiques of the commentariat (including this one). Quote his most hateful eruptions--about Mexicans, about Muslims, about women, about African Americans--and tomorrow will still bring an arena filled with voters who find him incorruptible precisely because he is rich, and who vibrate to his blunt assessments of the American condition. 

The question remains why the Trump phenomenon has proved so buoyant and impregnable. The socioeconomic forces are real, but Trump is also the beneficiary of a long process of Republican intellectual decadence. 

This is the political moment in which we live. The Republican Party, having spent years courting the basest impulses in American political culture, now sees the writing on the wall. It reads "Donald Trump," in very big letters.
