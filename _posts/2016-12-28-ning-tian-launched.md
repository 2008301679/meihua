title: "The struggle of my first paper"
---

Time flies. Now comes the end of 2016. It is the time to look back and to see what I did in the past year. 

In 2016 I took four courses: Adaptive Signal Processing, Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, Optimal Estimation, and Energy Storage System Control. Besides, I stepped into a second phase of PhD training, i.e., research study, and I submitted one conference paper and one journal paper at the end of this year. In June I flied back to China with my wife and held our wedding ceremony on July 9th in my hometown. After I returned back to America, I started a regular plan of jogging and swimming, almost three times per week. 

Although required to start doing research, I was not well prepared especially mentally. Every time when encountered with difficulties in research, I simply quit, turn to other easier stuff, and thus missed a few conference deadlines. I did not finish the paper until the end of this year. What a nightmare! Despite struggling with research, it is necessary and beneficial to review the whole preparation process of my first research paper.

**January 11**: Started the work of battery thermal modelling.

**February 25**: Got a stable matrix A.

**February 9**: A model for a battery cell was done.

**March 16**: A model for a battery pack consisting of three cells was developed.

**March 23**: Applied the Kalman filter on temperature distribution estimation of a battery pack.

**May 27**: Started trying to apply the DKF on battery pack and the corresponding stability proof.

**June 6**: Fixed the problem that matrix A became unstable when grids were finer.

**June 10**: The DKF codes of the battery pack were developed and a draft of the battery model was done.

**June 17**: Started writing the Introduction.

**June 18**: Applied a modified heat generation term related with currents, though constant still.

**June 19 â€“ July 18**: Back to China.

**July 29**: Started writing the Methodology.

**August 12**: The battery pack model part in the Methodology was done.

**August 13**: The heat generation term was modified to be time varying instead of being constant, and simulation results were greatly improved.

**August 15**: The decomposition strategy of the battery pack was changed to the one based on the battery number.

**August 19**: The Methodology was almost done.

**August 26**: Started writing the Result.

**September 9**: A paper draft except the Abstract and Conclusion was almost done and started the work of stability proof.

**September 19**: Submitted a conference paper, although the stability proof was unfinished.

**October 14**: Journal paper was almost done and ready to submit.

**November 12**: Paper was finally done and submitted.

In 2017 I would place research in the first place, to be more motivated and to earn more achievements.
