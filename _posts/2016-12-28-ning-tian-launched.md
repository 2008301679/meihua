title: "The struggle of my first paper."
---

Time flies. Now comes the end of 2016. It is the time to look back and to see what I did in the past year. 

In 2016 I took four courses: Adapative Singla Processing, Applied Numerical Linear Algebra, Optimal Estimation, and Energy Storage System Control. I started my research and submitted one conference paper and one journal paper. In June I flied back to China with my wife and held our wedding on July 9th in my hometown, Feicheng, Shandong. I started a regular swimming exercise since September. 

Due to my poor background on control, I laid my emphasis on course study and kind of ignored the research. In fact, for a Phd student, research is the most important and determinant. Although I still worked hard on my research, the work was driven by my supervisor or the deadline instead of by my personal motivation, which resulted in that I missed several conference deadlines and spent the whole year preparing the paper. I here make a list of the preparation for the paper, and it can be seen that the work is serverely delayed and I did not have clear idea about research. In the next year, I would put the research at the first place and try to motivate myself.



**January 11**: Start the work of battery thermal modelling.

**February 25**: Get a stable matrix A.

**February 9**: A model for a battery cell is done.

**March 16**: A model for a battery pack consisting of three cells is developed.

March 23: Apply the Kalman filter on temperature distribution estimation of a battery pack.

May 27: Start trying to apply the DKF on battery pack and the corresponding stability proof.

June 6: Fix the problem that matrix A becomes unstable when grids become finer.

June 10: The DKF codes of the battery pack are developed and a draft of the battery model is done.

June 17: Start writing the Introduction.

June 18: Apply a modified heat generation term related with currents, though constant still.

June 19 â€“ July 18: Back to China.

July 29: Start writing the Methodology.

August 12: The battery pack model part in the Methodology is done.

August 13: The heat generation term is modified to be time varying instead of being constant, and simulation results are greatly improved.

August 15: The decomposition strategy of the battery pack is changed to the one based on the battery number.

August 19: The Methodology is almost done.

August 26: Start writing the Result.

September 9: A paper draft except Abstract and Conclusion is almost done and start the work of stability proof.

September 19: Submit a conference paper, although the stability proof is unfinished.

October 14: Journal paper is almost done and ready to submit.

November 12: Paper is finally done and submitted.
