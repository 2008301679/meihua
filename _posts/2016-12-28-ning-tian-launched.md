|`**January 11**`|: Start the work of battery thermal modelling. 

February 25: Get a stable matrix A.

February 9: A model for a battery cell is done.

March 16: A model for a battery pack consisting of three cells is developed.

March 23: Apply the Kalman filter on temperature distribution estimation of a battery pack.

May 27: Start trying to apply the DKF on battery pack and the corresponding stability proof.

June 6: Fix the problem that matrix A becomes unstable when grids become finer.

June 10: The DKF codes of the battery pack are developed and a draft of the battery model is done.

June 17: Start writing the Introduction.

June 18: Apply a modified heat generation term related with currents, though constant still.

June 19 â€“ July 18: Back to China.

July 29: Start writing the Methodology.

August 12: The battery pack model part in the Methodology is done.

August 13: The heat generation term is modified to be time varying instead of being constant, and simulation results are greatly improved.

August 15: The decomposition strategy of the battery pack is changed to the one based on the battery number.

August 19: The Methodology is almost done.

August 26: Start writing the Result.

September 9: A paper draft except Abstract and Conclusion is almost done and start the work of stability proof.

September 19: Submit a conference paper, although the stability proof is unfinished.

October 14: Journal paper is almost done and ready to submit.

November 12: Paper is finally done and submitted.
