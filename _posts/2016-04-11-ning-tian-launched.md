SpaceX makes a historic sea landing

A spectacular manoeuvre for the Falcon 9 rocket.

On April 8th SpaceX, an American rockery firm founded by Elon Musk, completed one of its resupply missions to the International Space Stations (ISS). The journey is now a routine operation: the eighth such mission the company has flown, although one failed to reach orbit. This lauch, though, was more interesting than most, for two reasons.

One was that the Falcon 9 rocket was carrying a nifty new inflatable module designed to attach to the ISS. The second was that, following four previous failures, SpaceX at last managed to recover the first stage of its rocket by landing it on a platform on a drone ship stationed in the Atlantic.

It was a spectacular manoeuvre, with the rocket's first stage detaching itself as the second stage carried on into orbit. It required the first stage to flip itself around and re-light its engines to slow itself down. Using a mixture of rocket power and its fins, the first stage guided itself back through the atmosphere to land upright on the ocean-going robotic platform, amid many whoops and cheers from the watching SpaceX teams.

It was a technical triumph and an important milestone in Mr Musk's long-term plan to slash the cost of space flight. Even reusing the first stage could make a big difference: it accounts for around 70% of the $60m cost of a Falcon 9, according to Mr Musk.

SpaceX has landed a rocket on the ground before, as has Blue Origin, a competitor run by Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon. But SpaceX's achievement is more technically impressive. Blue Origin's rocket is smaller and is not capable of launching payloads into orbit: it essentially go straight up and then comes straight down again. SpaceX's sea landing demonstrates that it is possible to recover a much larger and faster-moving rocket even when its trajectory, as in this case, does not allow for a terrestrial landing. It represents a significant advance towards reducing the cost of lifting things into orbit.
