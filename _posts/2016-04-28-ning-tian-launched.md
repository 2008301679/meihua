How to measure prosperity

GDP is a bad gauge of material well-being. Time for a fresh approach.

Which would you prefer to be: a medieval monarch or a modern office-worker? The king has armies of servants. He wears the finest silks and eats the richest foods. But he is also a martyr to toothache. He is prone to fatal infections. It takes him a week by carriage to travel between palaces. And he is tired of listening to the same jesters. Life as a 21st century office drone looks more appealing once you think about modern dentistry, antibiotics, air travel, smartphone and Youtube.

The question is more than just a parlour game. It shows how tricky it is to compare living standards over time. Yet such comparisons are not just routinely made, but rely heavily on a single metric: gross domestic product (GDP). This one number has become shorthand for material well-being, even though it is a deeply flawed gauge of prosperity, and getting worse all the time. That may in turn be distorting levels of anxiety in the rich world about everything from stagnant incomes to disappointing productivity growth.

If GDP is failing on its own terms, as a measurement of the value-added in an economy, its use as a welfare benchmark is even more dubious. That has always been so: the benefits of santitation, better health care and the comforts of heating or air-conditioning meant that GDP growth almost certainly understated the true advance in living standards in the decades after the second world war. But at least the direction of travel was the same. GDP grew rapidly; so did quality of life. Now GDP is still growing (albeit more slowly), but living standards are thought to be stuck.

With a few exceptions, such as computers, what is produced and consumed is assumed to be of a constant quality. That assumption worked well enough in an ear of mass-produced, standardlised goods. It is less reliable when a growing share of the economy consists of services. The services to consumers provided by Google and Facebook are free, so are exluded from GDP. When paid-for goods, such as maps and music recordings, become more digital services they too drop out of GPD. The covenience of online shopping and banking is a boon to consumers . But if it means less investment in buildings, it detracts from GDP.
