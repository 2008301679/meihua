What is the point of the Commonwealth?

The new secretary-general will have to be tough, dynamic and crafty, if the oddest of post-imperial clubs is to rekindle its sense of purpose.

There's been an existential question-mark over the Commonwealth for some time. Ask citizens of the 53 countries that make up the Commonwealth what it is for, and most will shrug. Its most visible moment, which happens every four years, is a sports jamboree. A few years ago the Royal Commonwealth Society, which promotes the club, conducted a poll asking if respondents would be "sorry or appalled if your country left the Commonwealth". People in the poorer members were likeliest to answer "yes"; those in Britain, Australia and Canada tended to indifference. 

The modern Commonwealth was born in 1949, partly thanks to Jawaharlal Nehru, independent India's first prime minister, who had declared his country a republic but wanted to stay friends with the former imperial power and other former British dominions. The Commonwealth's purpose is twofold: to advance democracy and human rights; and to aid economic development. But on the first score it lacks a proper mechanism for enforcement. And on the second, it is not a big provider of cash.
