The problem with profits

Big firms in the United States have never had it so good. Time for more competition.

America used to be the land of opportunity and optimism. Now opportunity is seen as the preserve of the elite: two-thirds of Americans believe the economy is rigged in favour of vested interests. And optimism has turned to anger. The campaigns have found plenty of things to blame, from free-trade deals to the recklessness of Wall Street. But one problem with American capitalism has been overlooked: a corrosive lack of competition. 

Aggregate domestic profits of American firms are at near-record levels relative to GDP. High profits might be a sign of brilliant innovations or wise long-term investments, were it not for the fact that they are also suspiciously persistent. A very profitable American firm has an 80% chance of being that way ten years later. In the 1990s the odds were only about 50%. You might think that voters would be happy that their employers are thriving. But if they are not reinvested, or spent by shareholders, high profits can dampen demand. One response to the age of hyper-profitability would be simply to wait. Creative destruction takes time: previous episodes of peak profits--for example, in the late 1960s--ended abruptly. 

Having limited working capital and fewer resources, small companies struggle with all the forms, lobbying and red tapes. The ability of large firms to enter new markets and take on lazy incumbents has been muted by an orthodoxy among institutional investors that companies should focus on one activity and keep margins high. Warren Buffett, an investor, says he likes companies with "moats" that protect them from competition. America Inc has dug a giant defensive ditch around themselves. 

Most of the remedies dangled by politicians to solve America's economic woes would make things worse. Better to unleash a wave of competition. The first step is to take aim at cosseted incumbents. Modernising the antitrust apparatus would help. The second step is to make life easier for startups and small firms. 

A blast of competition would mean more disruption for some: firms in the S&P 500 employ about one in ten Americans. But it would create new jobs, encourage more investment and help lower prices. Above all, it would bring about a fairer kind of capitalism. That would lift America's spirits as well as their economy.
