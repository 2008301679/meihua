title: "Greece was supposed to return migrants to Turkey "
---

Compared with many Syrian asylum-seekers, Rima is in a `rather` comfortable `situation`. A teacher from Aleppo, she lives with her 18-month-old daughter in `a` central Athens hotel taken over by left-wing activists. Her application to be relocated to another country in the European Union `is making progress`: she may join her brother’s family in Spain by September. “I was fortunate,” she says. “I was on the boat to Athens on March 20th”—`the day the EU’s tough new policy` to deport asylum-seekers from the Greek islands back to Turkey `took effect`.
