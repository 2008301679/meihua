French missionaries brought grapes and the Gospel to Yunnan in the late 19th century; wine has been made in Cizhong ever since.They left a more enduring monument too: a sombre stone church with a charmingly incongruous Tibetan-style roof that sweeps skyward at its edges. A priest from Inner Mongolia holds masses there for ethnic-Tibetan Catholics.

But that is about to change. 

The dams will change the quality of the water in the river and the rate at which it flows. Some of this change could be for the better. Dams can prevent flooding by regulating the flow of water downstream. But some Mekong riverbank agriculture would not welcome too steady a flow. Increasing water in the dry season would shrink riverbeds, leaving less space for crops--millions of Mekong-basin dwellers grow vegetables on riverbanks.
