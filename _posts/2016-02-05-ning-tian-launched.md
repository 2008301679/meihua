HSBC: London v Hong Kong

East is Eden.

HSBC--one of the two most pivotal banks in the global financial systems, according to regulators, alongside JPMorgan Chase--exudes permanence. Its buildings are guarded by lions cast in bronze which passers-by touch for luck. HSBC has never been bailed out, nationalised or bought, a claim no other mega-bank can make. It has not made a yearly loss since its foundation in 1865. While its peers took emergency loans from central banks in the crisis of 2008-10, HSBC, long on cash, supplied liquidity to the financial system.

Yet behind that invincible aura lurks an insecurity: where is home? When Western and Indian merchants founded the bank in Asia in 1865, they considered basing it in Shanghai before settling on Hong Kong. Faced with wars, revolutions and the threat of nationalisation, the bank has chosen or been compelled to move its headquarters, or debated it, in 1941, 1946, 1981, 1986, 1990, 1993, 2008 and 2009.

HSBC believes its itinerance explains its survival. Countries and regimes come and go. The bank endures. Now it's decision time again. The results of a ten-month review of its domicile are likely to be announced on February 22nd. The main choice is between staying in London--where HSBC shifted its holding company in 1990-03, in anticipation of the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997--or going back to its place of birth.

...

A move to Hong Kong is thus a risk for HSBC. It is a bet that China will grow, but that its legal and financial systems will remain backward enough that Hong Kong will still have a vital role as the mainland's first-world entrepot. It is a bet that even as they meddle in Hong Kong's politics and on occasion break its laws, mainland officials will ultimately respect the principle of "one country, two systems". It is a gamble that America will resist its worst urges. In Hong Kong HSBC would be a catastrophic mistake away from losing its independence--but then the bank has never made a catastrophic mistake. Viewed from an insular Britain, Hong Kong is dangerous and alluring, just as it was 151 years ago.
