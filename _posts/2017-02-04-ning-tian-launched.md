谢林还推崇名声的重要性，认为这是一种有用的威慑力。尼克松很明白这一点，他有一套“疯汉理论”：让北越敌人相信他什么事都干得出来，包括按下核按钮。然而始终一致的行为和古怪的不可预测性具有同样的威慑力：如果你的对手相信你会说到做到，那么你的话语会塑造他们的行为。不过，这种方法的危险之处是它可能导致咬定一个愚蠢的战略不放，仅仅是为了保全面子。


Shallen also admires the importance of reputation and thinks of it as a useful warning power. Nickson knew well about it. He had a set of “crazy men theory” that made the North Vietnam enemies believe that he can do anything, including push the nuclear button. Yet actions that are always consistent have an equal warning power as that weird and unpredictable have: if your competent believes that you will do what you say, your words will influence their action. However, this way may have a dangerous result that you hold on to one stupid strategy just for the reputation.

Schelling also often promoted the importance of reputation as a useful deterrent. Richard Nixon understood this with what he called his “madman theory”: the idea of making the North Vietnamese enemy believe he was capable of anything, including pressing the nuclear button. But consistent behavior can have as deterrent an effect as erratic unpredictability: if your adversaries believe that you will keep your word, then your word can shape their actions. The danger of this approach, however, is that it could lead to perseverance with a stupid strategy, just to save face.

10月10日那个忙碌的早晨，尽管第三个打来电话的记者一再追问，他仍然不愿给年轻人什么忠告。“我不一定会劝谁……当经济学家。”他没有局限于任何学科，而是以身作则，对付世界上最让人担忧也最为棘手的一些问题。

On that busy morning on October 10th, although asked by the third journalist on the phone call again and again, he was still unwilling to give any advice to the young. “I am not sure whether I will argue somebody to be an economist”. He is not constrained to any subject. Instead, he makes himself an example to dealing with the most worried and difficult issues in the world.

```
On that busy morning of October 10th, when pressed by the third journalist of the morning, Mr Schelling refrained from advising young people. “I wouldn’t necessarily try to talk somebody into … becoming an economist”. Instead of being confined by any academic discipline, he led by example, tackling some of the world’s most worrying-and most intractable-problems.
