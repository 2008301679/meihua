Doctor-assisted dying will be legal in California from June 9th

After an agonizing delay, America's largest state will let doctors help the terminally ill to kill themselves.

California's lawmakers are moving slowly to implement a bill legalising doctor-assisted dying. Fair enough. The Economist supports the right of the terminally ill to die when and how they choose, and with the support of clinicians. However, the issue is difficult, and drawing up checks and balances is vital, so it is worth taking the time to get them right.

Even so, for residents of the most populous American state who are terminally ill and want a doctor's help to cut short their suffering, the wait has been protracted. In October 2015 California's governor, Jerry Brown, said he would not veto a bill that state lawmakers had passed the previous month. In a short open letter he said that he put the right of Californians to decide according to their own consciences ahead of his own religious beliefs (Mr Brown is a Catholic). Yet that was not the end of the story. Mr Brown supported the bill via a special legislative session called to discuss how the state should pay for doctor-assisted dying. His assent meant little until that session ended; 90 days after it adjourned, California's proposal would come into effect.
