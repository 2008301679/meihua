Patriotic goal

Big spending on foreign football players has a political aim, too.

Chinese demands for the world's commodities may be sputtering, but not for the most vital ingredient of football: its players. In recent weeks, the country's football clubs have been on their biggest ever spending spree, signing up foreign talent for sums which, by Asian standards, have been jaw-dropping. On local newspaper in China said anyone who paid attention to Chinese football would conclude that the clubs had "gone mad".

By the time China's two-month-long winter transfer-period ends on February 26th, its top-division clubs will have spent a net amount of around $300m. That is more than the combined net outlay of all the clubs in Europe's top five leagues during the winter period. Those in China's second division ranked third, at $55m.

Football is particularly important for Mr Xi. He has been a fan since childhood. Mr Xi's reform plan says football can help boost patriotism and a "collective spirit"--attributes Mr Xi is keen to inculcate in a society fractured by rapid economic change.

Mr Xi sees the game as a useful tool of diplomacy (his overseas visits often involve football related events). But China's league is still a long way from exerting the kind of soft power that the English Premier League bestows upon Britain (ask any taxi driver in China). Mr Xi has said he dreams of China winning the World Cup. England itself has no blueprint for that.
