美联储全速前进  
美联储在2016年一直推迟加息，现在有可能会加快加息的步伐  
美联储试图让自己变得可被预见。2015年12月，它自2006年以来首次提高利率，没有人感到特别意外。美联储事先已经将其意图全部表露无余。同样，如果金融市场上压倒一切的共识可信的话，在近一年后的12月14日，利率将再次上调，提升至0.5%至0.75%的目标区间。特朗普的推特和电话可能在短短几分钟内就会颠覆贸易、财政和外交政策，但是美联储主席耶伦（见图）谨慎调节货币政策的步伐可是一年才有一次。

America United Deposit speeds up  
In 2016, America United Deposit has been always postponing increasing interests. But now it may speed up the interest increase.  
America United Deposit tries to make itself visible. In December 2015, it increased interest rate for the first time since 2006. No one wondered about this because America United Deposit had totally exposed its intention to the public. Similarly, if the overwhelming consent in business market is believable, then the interest will grow again on December 14 this year, and reach the ambition interval 0.5%-0.7%. Maybe Trump’s call can turn down economy policy in just few minutes, but America United Deposit’s President Yelun merely adjusts money policy for one time each year.

```
Full speed a-Fed  
The Federal Reserve spent 2016 deferring rate rises. It might now speed them up.  
America’s central bank tries to be predictable. When in December 2015 it raised interest rates for the first time since 2006, nobody was much surprised. The central bank had telegraphed its intentions to a tee. Similarly, if the overwhelming consensus in financial markets is to be believed, on December 14th-almost exactly a year later-rates will rise again, to a target range of 0.5%-0.7%. Donald Trump’s tweets and phone calls may upend trade, fiscal and foreign policy in a matter of minutes, but Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve’s chairwoman (pictured), is tweaking monetary policy at only a cautious annual pace.

但在另一种意义上，美联储还是让预测落了空——至少是美联储自己所做的那些预测。一年前，美联储公开市场委员会过半委员预计2016年会有四次加息，但目前为止一次都还没有进行。这似乎是对一系列事件的直接反应。年初，对中国经济增长的担忧让美国股市下跌。6月，英国公投决定脱离欧盟，让市场再次波动了一段时间。但拖延加息还有一个原因，即美联储官员逐渐接受了一个现实：低利率已成为经济发展一个更长期的特征。9月，大多数委员都预计利率最终将设定在3%以下。而一年前“看涨”之时，预期还是3.5%。自6月以来，耶伦一直说低利率只是“温和地”刺激经济。

But in another sense of meaning, the Federal Reserve still makes expectations fall down—at least those made by the Federal Reserve itself. One year ago, in the Opening Market Committee of the Federal Reserve, more than half members expected four rates rise in 2016, but none has happened up to now. This seems being a direct reaction to a series of matters. At the beginning of the year, the worries about China’s economic increase made American stock market fall down. In June, England’s national votes to leaving European League made the market wave again for some time. But there is another reason for postponing rates rise, that is, the Federal Reserve officers gradually accepted such a fact that low rates are a more long-time-during characteristic for economic development. In September, most of the committee members expected the final rates below 3%, while it was 3.5% one year ago when economic rates were popularly highlighted. Since June, Yellen was always saying that low rates only stimulate the economy mildly.

```
Yet in another sense, the Fed has confounded predictions—at least, those it made itself. A year ago the median rate-setter foresaw four rate rises in 2016. None has happened yet. This might seem like a straightforward reaction to events. At the start of the year, stockmarkets sagged on worries about Chinese growth. Then, in June, Britain voted to leave the European Union, sending markets spinning again for a while. But the delay also resulted from a gradual acceptance by Fed officials that low rates have become a longer-lasting feature of the economy. In September most rate-setters expected rates eventually to settle below 3%. This is down from 3-5% at the time of “life-off” a year ago. Since June Ms Yellen has been saying that low rates are only “modestly” juicing the economy.
```

然而现在美联储准备好再次调息。劳动力市场的变化能为我们揭示个中原因。一年前，失业率已经低至5%。从那以后，美国经济平均每月创造18.8万个工作岗位。起初，这促使核心年龄工人的劳动力参与率大幅增加（金融危机之后这一比率的跌幅令人担忧）。劳动参与率从2015年9月80.6%的低点上升到2016年10月的81.6%，比1985年以来任何一次上升的势头都要强劲。尽管工作岗位数稳健增长，不断增加的求职人数仍让失业率基本维持不变。

But now the Fed is ready to change the rates again. The variation in labor markets can reveal some certain reasons for us. A year ago, job-lost rates were as low as 5%. Since then America economy created 188,000 job opportunities each month. At first, it greatly increased labor participation rates of cone-aged workers (its great sag after economic crisis is worrying). Labor participation rates increases from 80.6% in September 2015 to 81.6% in October 2016, the increase of which is stronger than any time since 1985. Although the number of labor opportunities increases in a steady speed, increasingly job seekers make job-lost rates almost unchanged.

```
Now, though, the Fed is ready to move again. A look at the labor markets reveals why. A year ago unemployment was already low at 5%. Since then the economy has created an average of 188,000 jobs per month. At first this helped the labor-force participation of prime-age workers, which fell worryingly after the crisis, to surge. It rose from a trough of 80.6% in September 2015 to 81.6% by October 2016, a spurt faster than any since 1985. Swelling numbers of jobseekers kept unemployment roughly steady despite robust job growth.
```

然而，11月份的劳动参与率略有下降。结果，职位增加再次推低了失业率，目前仅为4.6%，是自2007年8月以来录得的最低水平。美联储公开市场委员会的16位委员于9月发布了预测，其中至少13位认为这样的失业率低于其长期可持续水平。

In November, however, the labor-force participation declined slightly. Then, job opportunity growth pushed unemployment down again, which now is merely 4.6%, the lowest level recorded since August 2007. In September 16 officials in the Fed Opening Market Committee made a prediction, and at least 13 among believed that such an unemployment rate was lower than the long-lasting-capable level.

```
In November, however, participation fell slightly. As a result, job creation is once again pushing unemployment down. It now stands at 4.6%, the lowest rate recorded since August 2007. That is below its long-run sustainable level, according to at least 13 of 16 Fed rate-setters who penned forecasts in September.
```

鹰派人士认为劳动参与率已经达到极限，所以劳动力市场上再没什么空间可压缩了。市场上涌现出许多其他参考数据。德意志银行的托斯腾·斯洛克（Torsten Slok）表示，现在要填补一个岗位空缺需要28天时间，2006年只需23天。公司不论大小，都将招聘困难列入其首要问题之中。特朗普大张旗鼓地宣传自己保护就业岗位、使之不因外包而流失的执政目标，9月被裁员或辞退的工人数比2000年开始收集相关数据以来的任何一个月都少。

The Eagles believed that participation had reached its limits so that no room can be compressed in the labor market. Many other reference data came up in the market. Torsten Slok, from Germany Bank, said that now it needs 28 days to make up for a blank position while the number was 23 in 2006. No matter what size of a company is, it all added recruitment difficulty to prime problems. Trump advised his policy goal of job position protection and stopped it from losing on allocating outside. The number of fired or declined workers is smaller than any month recorded since 2000.

```
Hawks argue that participation has reached its limit, so little slack remains in the labor market. Other thermometers are popping. It now takes 28 days to fill a vacancy, up from 23 days in 2006, notes Torsten Slok of Deutsche Bank. Company small and large list hiring difficulties among their top concerns. For all the fanfare over Mr Trump’s agenda to protect jobs from outsourcing, fewer workers were laid off or fired in September than in any month since data started being collected in 2000.
