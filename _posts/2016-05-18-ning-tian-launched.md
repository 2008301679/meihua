title: "Why apple music is so bad when the iphone is so good."

On April 28, 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store, `saving` the music industry `from` the scourge of piracy while creating a `large and steady source` of revenue for Apple. Thirteen years later,  however, what started as a simple and intuitive way to find music has become a cluttered festoonery of features. As Apple begins competing with focused streaming services like Spotify, the company's strategy of tacking new services, like Apple Music, which became available last year, onto already bloated software has made the `experience` of using the application more and more `unpleasant`. Just last week, Apple `acknowledged` users' complaints about a bug that was deleting music files on personal computers, and promised a quick software update. Many Apple Music customers took to the Internet to warn their fellow-users to `back their stuff up`. So when Apple said that it would release a new streamlined version of Apple Music at its developers' conference next month, it seemed as though the company was finally reckoning with the confusion in its music services.

Apple may, in fact, clear up some of the mess and present a simpler solution, but its struggles in the delivery of music are merely `a symptom of a deeper problem`: how to provide Internet services. 

Apple has always been, and always will be, a hardware-first company. It produces beautiful devices with elegant designs and humane operating-system software. It sets the industry standard with its chips and innovative uses of material. Its engineers design manufacturing processes to make lighter, thinner, and more desirable devices. These efforts take time, which is perhaps `a reason` the company likes to make a big splash when it announces new devices a handful of times each year. This hardware-centric approach is extended to software, with big-bang releases once or twice a year. Such a schedule works when the software is a desktop operating system, say, or a mobile iOS, both of which get minor updates whenever necessary. But `when it comes to` Internet services, a yearly release cycle feels dated. To perform well, these services need constant tinkering based on how people are actually using them.

Apple, by comparison, designs and builds products with a very distinct vision of what a product will do and how its customers will want to engage with it. This works well for hardware, just as it did for pre-Internet software. But `it doesn't serve to` capture the unexpected or mundane behavior of people on the Internet, and it certainly doesn't allow the company to learn or adapt as quickly as others.

Apple is phenomenally successful, but like Microsoft, which stumbled when Google's Internet-only, advertising-based business took off, it may find it difficult to adapt success to new terrain. 

It's not impossible for companies to adapt to new circumstances. Netflix made a bumpy transition from physical goods to digital services, and has now become a `preeminent` entertainment channel, one that mines user data successfully. Whatever Apple does, it is time for Cupertino to make some quick and bold moves.
