Why women book their business trips earlier than men

"Men know life too early. Women know life too late", wrote Oscar Wilde. Not so for road warriors. A new report from Carson Wagonlit Travel, a corporate-travel firm, found that women, on average, book their business flights around two days earlier than men. This means that women save their firms on average of %17 a trip, around 2% of the ticket price. Women account for around half of business trips in America. Most enjoy it. According to research by Judi Brownel of Cornell University, female executives think corporate travel contributes to their professional advancement, provides freedom from daily routines and widen their worldview. Another CWT study suggests that women find business travel more stressful. Compared with men, they get more anxious about things such as lost or delayed baggage, poor internet connections and not being able to eat healthily. 

Is women's greater organisation when booking trips linked to their high levels of stress when travelling? It is difficult to say, but it is possible. The CWT team speculate:"One explanation is that women, anticipating the higher stress they report having while travelling, tend to be more organised in an effort to offset their anticipated travel stress."

Booking early is certainly helpful for corporations with an eye on expenses. But it might also be a symptom of an underlying problem.
