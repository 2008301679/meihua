`Fraud`, bureaucracy and an `obsession with` quantity over quality still `hold` Chinese science back.

China seems to `swing` from `insecurity` about its science to `hubris`. In 2015, when Tu Youyou, a pharmacologist, became the first scientist to win a Nobel prize for work `carried out` in China, the state media’s reaction was `not` to celebrate her `ground-breaking` medicinal chemistry. `Rather`, they claimed that the award was a recognition of traditional Chinese medicine—something she said had little to do with the work that won her the award.

This week Xi Jinping, China’s president, fell into the opposite trap, of overconfidence. `Addressing` a sea of scientists at a `joint meeting` in Beijing of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering and the China Association for Science and Technology, he `repeated his government’s aim` that China should become a leading scientific innovator by 2030 and a dominant scientific country by 2049 (`a date chosen because` it is the 100th anniversary of the communist takeover).
