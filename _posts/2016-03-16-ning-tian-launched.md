Business are embracing the idea of working in teams

But managing them is hard.

Teams have become the basic building-blocks of organisations. Recruitment ads routinely call for "team players". Business schools grade their students in part on their performance in group projects. Office managers knock down walls to encourage team-building. Teams are as old as civilisation, of course: even Jesus had 12 co-workers. But a new report by Deloitte, "Global Human Capital Trends", based on a survey of more than 7,000 executives in over 130 countries, suggests that the fashion for teamwork has reached a new high. Almost half of those surveyed said their companies were either in the middle of restructuring or about to embark on it; and for the most part, restructuring means putting more emphasis on teams.

However, companies need to think harder about managing teams. They need to rid their minds of sentimental egalitarianism: the most successful teams have leaders who set an overall direction and clamp down on dithering and waffle. They need to keep teams small and focused: giving in to pressure to be more "inclusive" is a guarantee of dysfunction. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's boss, says that "if I see more than two pizzas for lunch, the team is too big." They need to immunize teams against groupthink: Hackman argued that the best ones contain "deviants" who are willing to ruffle feathers.  

However, organisations need to learn something bigger than how to manage teams better: they need to be in the middle of the habit of asking themselves whether the teams are the best tools for the job. Slackly managed teams can become hotbeds of distraction--employees routinely complain that they can't get their work done because they are forced to spend too much time in meetings or compelled to work in noisy offices. Even in the age of open-plan offices and social networks some work is best left to the individual.
