最大的缓和  
10月19日，中国公布第三季度经济增速为6.7%。这原本会是一个意料之中、令人欣慰的标题，只是中国上个季度以及再上个季度都公布了完全相同的增长率数字。这种异乎寻常的一致遭到了中国许多“数据怀疑论者”的鄙视。这些人一直认为中国在数字上弄虚作假。中国已经有很多次连续两个季度增速相同了。但此前它还从未连续三个季度公都布完全相同的增速。  

The biggest mitigation  
On October 19th, China announced that its economy increase in the third season was 6.7%. It was supposed to be an expected and inspiring caption. However, this increase number is exactly the same with that in the last season and that before the last season. This unbelievable agreement suffers denouncement from many criticists who believe that China presents the fake number for a long time. It happened many times that the increasing number did not change for two straight seasons. But it never occurs before that the increasing numbers are the same with each other for three straight seasons. 

```
The greatest moderation     
On October 19th China reported that its economy grew by 6.7% in the third quarter. It would have been an unsurprising, reassuring headline, except that China had reported exactly the same figure for the previous quarter-and for the quarter before that. This freakish consistency invited the scorn of China’s many “data doubters”, who have long argued that it fudges its figures. China has expanded at the same pace from one quarter to the next on numerous occasions. But it has never before claimed to grow at exactly the same rate for three quarters in a row. 
```


其他地方有过类似的情况吗？这种增速“三连同”并非完全没有先例。根据本刊的姐妹公司经济学人智库（EIU）始于1993年、涵盖83个国家的数据库，另有七个国家曾报告过连续三个季度都相同的经济增速。它们包括巴西、克罗地亚、印度尼西亚、马来西亚和越南等新兴经济体，但也包括奥地利和西班牙这两个成熟经济体。事实上，西班牙已经创造过两次这种一致性的奇迹。它在2003年前三个季度的同比增长均为3.1%，2006年前三个季度则各增长4.2%。那真是一段美好的时光。

Did such a situation happen before in somewhere else? It indeed happened before. Based on the database of the Economist’s sister company EIS, which starts from 1993 and consists of 83 countries, there are seven countries who ever reported economic growth figures that are the same in three consistent quarters. They include emerging economic entities like Brazil, Coluodia, Indonisia, Malasya, and Vietnam, and also include two mature economic entities--Audily and Spanish. In fact, Spanish ever experienced two times of such a miracle. In the first three quarters in 2003 and 2006, its economy grew by 3.1% and 6.7%, respectively. What a great time!

```
Anywhere else? This growth “three-peat” is not entirely without precedent. Seven other countries have reported the same growth rate for three quarters in a row, according to a database spanning 83 countries since 1993, compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company. The list includes emerging economies like Brazil, Croatia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, but also two mature economies: Austria and Spain. Indeed, Spain has performed this miracle of consistency twice. It grew by 3.1% (year-on-year) in the first three quarters of 2003 and by 6.7% in the first three quarters of 2006. Those were the days.

与普遍看法相反，中国的GDP统计数字并不总是异乎寻常地平缓。1993年以来，两个季度增速之间的平均差为（正/负）0.77个百分点（见图表）。美国等14个国家公布的增速平均差均小于这一数字。但近年来，中国的之字形增长已经不再明显。2012年以来，只有法国和约旦享有比中国更稳定的增长（用一种衡量波动性的常用方法，即统计方差来测量），而且只有印尼录得过比中国更小的季度增速平均差。

Contrast to a popular opinion, China’s GDP statistic figures are not always changing as a flat curve. Since 1993, the average of growth rate differences between two quarters is 0.77% (positive/negative), see graph. It is larger than the figure reported by fourteen other countries like America. But in recent years, we can hardly see the zig-zag growth rate. Since 2012, only France and Yodan performed steadier growth rate compared with China (the fluctuation is measured using statistic variance).  

```
Contrary to popular belief, China’s GDP statistics have not always been unusually smooth. Since 1993, the average gap between one quarter’s growth and the next has been (plus or minus) 0.77 percentage points (see table). Fourteen countries, including America, have reported a smaller average gap. But in recent years, the zigzags in China’s growth have been less pronounced. Since 2012 only France and Jordan have enjoyed more stable growth (as measured by statistical variance, a common measure of volatility).  
```

要么是中国的政策制定者近来在稳定增长方面颇为成功，要么就是中国的统计人员最近决定要平滑数据。但如果是统计人员在捣鬼，那么人们不禁纳闷，为什么他们不更努力些，好好把这一点隐藏起来呢。

China’s policy makers may have been successful in maintaining steady growth in recent years, or statistical officers are deciding to make figures smooth. But if these figures are changed by statistical officers, people will wonder why they do not try harder to hide their action from being discovered.

```
Either China’s policy makers are newly successful at stabilizing growth or statisticians are newly determined to smooth the data. But if the number-crunchers are to blame, one wonders why they do not try harder to hide it.
