Super Tuesday: all to play for in the US primaries

Super Tuesday has arrived. Voters in dozen states will have their say on who they want as the Democratic or Republican candidate for president, more than on any other day during the nomination process. Most states will hold a primary election and a few, such as Minnesota, will hold caucus meetings. Half the states are southern, giving the Super Tuesday electorate a particular demographic tilt. On the Democratic side black voters will make up a third to half the electorate in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia; in Texas over a third of the voters will be Hispanic and another fifth will be black. After her big win in South Carolina, where she took 86% of the black vote, Hillary Clinton is expected to do well. Bernie Sanders will win in Vermont, his home state (around 85% of Democrats there are expected to support him). He also has a fair chance of scooping up some delegates in Colorado, Massachusetts and Minnesota, which have lots of the type of white liberals and college students who propelled "the Bern" in New Hampshire.

In the Republican race, the polls suggest Ted Cruz will come first in his native Texas, and that Donald Trump will win pretty much everywhere else. Marco Rubio could produce a surprise in Minnesota and possibly Georgia.
