Error found in study of first ancient African genome

Finding that much of Africa has Eurasian ancestry was mistaken.

An error has forced researchers to go back on their claim that humans across the whole of Africa carry DNA inherited from Eurasian immigrants.

Manica says that the error occurred when his team compared genetic variants in the ancient Ethiopian man with those in the reference human genome. Incompatibility between the two software packages used caused some variants that the Ethiopian man shared with Europeans (whose DNA forms a large chunk of the human reference sequence) to be removed from the analysis. The researchers did have a script that they could have run to harmonize the two software packages, says Manica, but someone forgot to run it.

Manica is not yet sure if Science will change the title of the paper, 'Ancient Ethiopian genome reveals extensive Eurasian admixture throughout the African continent'. But if the team had caught the error earlier, he says, "I'm sure we would have phrased things differently".
