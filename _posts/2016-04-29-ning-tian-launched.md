Law, not culture, is Europe's answer to Islam, a pundit says

As one of America's veteran observers of international affairs, Robert D. Kaplan loves to delve into vast cultural, religious and geopolitical theme. The subjects touched by his books and essays have included the social capital provided by Islam in Turkish slums, the looming strategic competition in the Pacific, and the culture of the American military, view through the lens of late-Roman and early-Christian history.

In recent writings he has returned to his old European stomping grounds. It is 30 years since his travel round the moribund communist polities of south-eastern Europe prompted him to write Balkan Ghosts, a book that strongly influenced president Bill Clinton. It showed how older fault lines, including Catholic-Orthodox rivalry, were re-emerging as the communist permafrost melted.

In his latest book, In Europe's Shadow, he goes back to Romania, and finds pleasant surprises, including a happy mixture of devoutly practiced eastern Christianity and pro-Western strategic orientation. A country that was literally a dark place in the 1980s, because of economic misery, power shortages and an exceptionally harsh for of communism, has lightened up in many ways, he discovers. Corruption may flourish but so too does healthy political opposition to that vice. If his optimism is well-founded, then we have to conclude that eastern Christianity and Western political alignment may, after all, be compatible, despite the claims to the contrary by the late Professor Sam Huntington, who popolarised the idea of a "clash of civilisations" as a driver of global conflict.

Meanwhile, in a short essay published in the current issue of the Atlantic, Mr Kaplan goes on to consider an even more sensitive theme, under the teasing title of "How Islam Created Europe". As a description of what happened in the early Middle Age, when Christian rulers forged new alliances as they teamed up against the forces of Islam, that title may not be very original, but Mr Kaplan believes that the catchphrase also has some relevance to modern history. For most of the time since 1945, he argues, democratic Europe was cosily circumscribed and sheltered: not just from communism by the Iron Curtain, but also from the world of Islam by the authoritarian secular regimes which held sway in North Africa and the Middle East.
