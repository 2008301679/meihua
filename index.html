	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Ning Tian.</span></p>
	<p>I come from China and now I am pursuing my doctorate degree in University of Kansas. My research is on real-time estimate of lithium battery temperature.</p>
	
	<p>Some research tips proposed by Leonard Jimmie Savage, which I would like to share with everyone. </p>
	<p>As soon as a problem is stated, start right away to solve it. Use simple examples.</p>
	<p>Keep starting from first principles, explaining again and again what you are trying to do.</p>
	<p>Believe that this problem can be solved and that you will enjoy working it out.</p>
	<p>Don't be hampered by the original problem statement.</p>
	<p>Try other problems in its neighborhood; maybe there is a better problem than yours.</p>
	<p>Work an hour or so on it frequently.</p>
	<p>Talk about it; explain it to other people.</p>
